# react-ml-app

This pet project of mine serves as an end-to-end example of how to create a privacy-first machine learning application that runs in the browser. It demonstratetes how to train a PyTorch model with fastai, export it to ONNX format and run it in the browser using onnx.js inside a react app.

## Goal

Because I am a dog lover (sorry cat friends, but you can easily train your own classifier model and build an app for cat breeds!), my goal is to create a simple, yet functional and realistic react app that can classify a dog's breed using an image of dog. The app should be user friendly, so I could actually use it when I am interested in what breed a certain dog is that I encountered.

## Demo

## The model

I used the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), which contains 137 different breeds of dogs with about 150 images per breed.

The training process is described in detail in [this jupyter notebook](train_dog_classifier_with_fastai_export_to_ONNX.ipynb). Note: You can [run this notebook for free in Google Colabatory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidpfahler/react-ml-app/blob/master/train_dog_classifier_with_fastai_export_to_ONNX.ipynb) if you have a Google account.

I am using a resnet18 architecture, but I am planning to investigate more efficient architectures in the future and will update this project accordingly if I find them to be useful.

## The Frontend

The fairly simple react app was set up using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), see [cra-instructions.md](cra-instructions.md) for the generated README file. On top of react, I am using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), a very powerful react imlementation of the [material design language](https://material.io/).

To load and run the model, I am using [onnx.js](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs) by Microsoft, which can load ONNX formatted machine learning models in node or the browser.

## The Backend

Therer is no backend! Because the model runs in the browser, you don't need a server that runs the model and you preserve your users privacy. You can have your ðŸŽ‚ and eat it too!

## The details

If you want to learn more about the details of each aspect of this project, I will publish a detailed article about it on davidpfahler.com soon, which will include tricks and tweaks used during training and to export the model, how to get onnx.js to behave and more.
